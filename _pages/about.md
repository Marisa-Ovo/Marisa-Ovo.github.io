<span style="color: #003366; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.7em;">About Me</span>
======
I am currently an undergraduate student studying Artificial Intelligence at the School of Future Technology, South China University of Technology, advised by [Prof. Qi Liu](https://drliuqi.github.io/) on music generation and machine learning. I also work closely with [Music X Lab](https://www.musicxlab.com/#/), where I am guided by [Prof. Gus Xia](https://www.musicxlab.com/members/gus/) and [Dr. Ziyu Wang](https://zzwaang.github.io/).

======
The primary goal of my research is to develop effective representations for symbolic music that balance structural preservation with encoding efficiency. I believe that effective representation is the foundation for tackling various downstream tasks in symbolic music, from understanding to generation.

To address this challenge, I integrate methods from computer vision and natural language processing to design a novel symbolic music representation. Currently, my method has achieved promising results on piano datasets, demonstrating the potential of this cross-modal strategy. I aim to refine this approach and validate it across diverse instruments and applications, working toward a state-of-the-art representation framework for symbolic music.
