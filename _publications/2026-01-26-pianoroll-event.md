## Abstract

We introduce an encoding scheme that merges pianoroll representations with event-based descriptions. Our approach defines four event types:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Frame Events** | Capture temporal structure of musical segments |
| **Gap Events** | Handle silence and rests between notes |
| **Pattern Events** | Encode repetitive musical patterns efficiently |
| **Structure Events** | Represent high-level musical form |

This scheme achieves **1.36x to 7.16x encoding efficiency** compared to comparable discrete sequence approaches. Testing across multiple autoregressive models demonstrates consistent performance gains in both objective metrics and human evaluation.
