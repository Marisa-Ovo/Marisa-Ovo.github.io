======
I am currently an undergraduate student studying Artificial Intelligence at the School of Future Technology, South China University of Technology. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and music information retrieval.

======
**How can we effectively represent symbolic music?** This question is challenging due to the dual structural nature of the data—it can be viewed as images (Piano Roll) while also exhibiting sequential characteristics (temporal notes).

To address this challenge, I integrate methods from computer vision and natural language processing to design a novel Piano Roll serialization approach. Currently, this method has achieved promising results on piano datasets, initially demonstrating the potential of this cross-modal strategy. I aim to refine this method and validate it across diverse instruments and downstream tasks, working toward establishing a state-of-the-art representation framework for symbolic music.
